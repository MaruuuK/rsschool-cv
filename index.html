                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Relocation with my boyfriend to another country forced me to think about changing my careeir path.
                    For me it was
                    extremely important to have an opportunity work remontly in IT sphare. After doing some reserch, I
                    have started
                    passionated about Frontend Development.
                    This occupation provides endless possibilities for improving skils and being creative working on
                    different projects.
                    Besides it is a flexible career, and an opportunity working from anywhere is important for me.
                    I believe that my ability to learn quickly, be goal oriented, and my personal interest will help me
                    become an expert in
                    chosen field.</p>
